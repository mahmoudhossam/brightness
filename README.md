### Automatic brightness script for Windows
This script should update a monitor's brightness using ddcci based on an external ambient light sensor available through the Home Assistant REST API

Fill in the values in the `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env` to be able to run `main.go`

TODO: Make this monitor for changes in the sensor values and create a windows service
